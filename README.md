# Post-Covid-19-Demand-for-Share-Bikes
Use of regression and RFE to identify the demand drivers for a company that rents 'shared bikes'



### Bike Sharing Regression ModelÂ¶
#### BoomBikes
#### `Problem Statement:`
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

The company wants to know:

 - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes

 - How well those variables describe the bike demands


This regression and RFE modelling notebook works through the pre-processing of the data, which is provided (day.csv), iterates through the modeling process, and reaches a conclusion in terms of the best drivers and answers to the questions the Company is seeking.

Hopefully this is a good guide for those attempting similar types of analysis.

Feel free to leave comments or questions.

Thanks, Mark
